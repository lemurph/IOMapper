# How to run example projects:

##### This is a generic walkthrough of how to run the demo projects:

The easiest way to run the example projects provided in the 'godot_examples' folder is to use webmapper. A tutorial on how to use webmapper can be found in the 'webmapper' submodule folder's README, or on the webmapper github page.

Running all of the projects consists of a similar process; The project file must be opened in Godot and the scene must be run, then one of the various .py python files must be running. Once both are running, the signals should appear in webmapper where they are easily mappable.

Once the output signal is mapped to the input, the python program should be able to modify the mapped properties in the godot scene.
