Version 1.2
-----------

Released 4 March 2019

We are pleased to annouce the release of version 1.2 of libmapper, an open-source, cross-platform software library for declaring data signals on a shared network and enabling arbitrary connections to be made between them. The main focus of libmapper development is to provide tools for creating and using systems for interactive control of media synthesis.

Changes of note since the 1.1 release include

* Improvements to the *map slot* API
* Added the ability to configure maps at runtime to use either UDP or TCP for transport.
* Improvements to the device name allocation process.
* Changes to the C++ and Java device queue API to match the approach used for the Python bindings.
* Fixes for callback thread handling in the SWIG/Python bindings.
* Fixes and improvements for handling of expired devices by the Database.
* Updated the makefile for Java bindings to use `javac -h` since `javah` is no longer available on current versions of the JDK.
* Updates to tutorials, examples and test programs.

Bugfixes:

* Prevent user code from rewriting map ids.
* Ensure devices are marked as subscribed if a subscription is added manually during the temporary subscription window.
* Fixed initialisation of the device ordinal property.
* Fixed a timetag subtraction bug.
* "/map" messages targeting existing maps are now forwarded correctly.

* Added simple check for map feedback loops,.
* Updated tests and tutorials.
* Extension and simplification of the C++ headers, along with new API documentation.
* Extension of the SWIG/Python bindings to support *convergent maps*.

Bugfixes include:

* Treat properties named 'maximum' and 'minimum' as aliases for 'max' and 'min'.
* Database autosubscribe flags were overwriting configurations of user-code subscription created in device callback.
* Fix for input history memory allocation in expression parser.

Version 1.0
-----------

Released Jan 4, 2016.

This release includes many API changes, improvements, and new
features since version 0.4. They are summarized very briefly here:

### Structural changes

The data structures in libmapper have been reconceived to increase consistency
and clarity. Some data structures have been merged and/or renamed:

* `mapper_device` + `mapper_db_device` ––> `mapper_device`
* `mapper_signal` + `mapper_db_signal` ––> `mapper_signal`
* `mapper_link` + `mapper_db_link` ––> `mapper_link`
* `mapper_connection` + `mapper_db_connection` ––> `mapper_map`
* `mapper_admin` ––> `mapper_network`
* `mapper_monitor` ––> (removed)
* `mapper_db` ––> `mapper_database`

This means that the database now represents remote devices and signals using the
same data structures that are used for local devices and signals. Property
getter and setter functions for these structures are the same whether the entity
is local or remote. The property getter `<object>_is_local()` can be used to
retrieve whether the data structure represents a local resource.

The `mapper_map` structure is now a "top-level" object, and is used for
creating, modifying, and destroying mapping connections. Changes to a map (and
to other structures that represent non-local resources) must be explicitly
synchronized with the network using the `_push()` function, e.g.:

    mapper_map map = mapper_map_new(num_srcs, outsigs, num_dsts, insigs);
    mapper_map_set_expression(map, "y=x+2");
    mapper_map_push(map);

Or in C++:

    mapper::Map map(outsig, insig);
    map.set_expression("y=x+2");
    map.push();

Or in Python:

    map = mapper.map(outsig, insig)
    map.expression = "y=x+2"
    map.push()

Or in Java:

    mapper.Map map = new mapper.Map(outsig, insig);
    map.setExpression("y=x+2");
    map.push();

In all these cases the arguments for the map constructor are no longer the
*names* of the signals in question, but are **signal objects**: `mapper_signal`
in C, `mapper::Signal` in C++, etc. These could be local signals or signals
retrieved from the database.

There is also a new data structure called `mapper_slot` for representing map
endpoints (see below under **convergent mapping**). This means that for properties
such as minimum, maximum, and boundary behaviours it is the *slot* property that
needs to be set.

### Function naming

The names of many functions have been changed to make them consistent with the
names of the data structures they concern, e.g. `mdev_poll()` has been renamed
to `mapper_device_poll()`.

### Database queries

Previous versions of libmapper contained many duplicate functions for accessing
e.g. signals belonging to a device: one for retrieving them from a `mapper_device`
and another for retrieving them from the database. In version 1.0 all object
queries have been unified, and children of objects (e.g. signals, maps) are
retrieved by querying their parent. For example, all devices can be retrieved
from the database like this:

    mapper_device *devs = mapper_database_devices(db);
    while (devs) {
        printf("retrieved device '%s'\n", mapper_device_name(*devs));
        devs = mapper_device_query_next(devs);
    }

The old way of retrieving the output signals belonging to a particular device
was to call:

    mapper_db_signal *sigs = mapper_db_get_outputs_by_device_name(db, name);

and the new way:

    mapper_device dev = mapper_database_device_by_name(db, name);
    mapper_signal *sigs = mapper_device_signals(dev, MAPPER_DIR_OUTGOING);

Queries can be combined using `union`, `intersection`, or `difference`
operators, making it easy to e.g. find maps with a specific source and
destination device without requiring a dedicated function to do so:

    mapper_map *src, *dst, *combo;
    
    src = mapper_device_maps(src_dev, MAPPER_DIR_OUTGOING);
    dst = mapper_device_maps(dst_dev, MAPPER_DIR_INCOMING);
    combo = mapper_map_query_intersection(src, dst);
    
    while (combo) {
        mapper_map_print(*combo);
        maps = mapper_map_query_next(combo);
    }

The data structures `mapper_device`, `mapper_signal`, and `mapper_map` can also
now be queried by arbitrary property, making it quite easy to build arbitrary
queries:

    // retrieve all maps with the property 'foo' where its value is < 10
    int value = 10;
    mapper_map *maps = mapper_database_maps_by_property(db, "foo", 1, 'i',
                                                        &value,
                                                        MAPPER_OP_LESS_THAN);

### Convergent mapping

*Convergent* (or *many-to-one*) mapping refers to scenarios in which multiple
source signals are connected to the same destination signal. Prior to 1.0,
libmapper would allow a naïve implementation of convergent mapping: multiple
sources could be connected to a given destination, but their values would
overwrite each other at each source update. Starting with version 1.0, three
other methods for convergent mapping are also available:

* _Updating specific vector elements or element ranges_. By using the vector
indexing functionality mentioned above, parts of vector destinations can be
updated by different sources; vectors updates are now null-padded so elements
not addressed in the expression property will not be overwritten
* _Destination value reference_. References to past values of the destination in
the expression string (e.g. `y=y{-1}+x`) now refer to the _actual value_ of the
destination signal rather than the output of the expression. If the past
behaviour is desired, a user-defined variable can be used to cache the
expression output (e.g. `foo=foo{-1}+x; y=foo`). Note that if the destination value
is referenced in the expression string, libmapper will automatically move signal
processing to the destination device.
* _Multi-source maps_. Lastly, maps can now be created with multiple source
signals, and expressions can specify arbitrary combinations of the source values.
To support this functionality, the endpoints of maps are now represented using the
`mapper_slot` data structure; each map has a single destination slot and at
least one source slot. Several properties that used to belong to connections
have been moved to the map slots:

  * `map->range` ––> `slot->minimum` and `slot->maximum`
  * `map->bound_max` ––> `slot->bound_max`
  * `map->bound_min` ––> `slot->bound_min`
  * `map->send_as_instance` ––> `slot->use_as_instance`

Calibration used to be specified using the connection mode `MO_CALIBRATE`. It is
now specified using the slot property `calibrating`.

If all source slots belong to the same device, signal processing will be handled
by the source device by default, otherwise the destination will handle
evaluation of the expression. This can be controlled by setting the
`process_location` property of a map to either `MAPPER_LOC_SOURCE` or
`MAPPER_LOC_DESTINATION`. If a map has sources from different devices, or if the
map expression references the value of the destination (`y{-n}`) the processing
location will be set to `MAPPER_LOC_DESTINATION`.

The `mode` property of maps has changed a bit:

* `MO_BYPASS` has been removed since it didn't really describe what was going
on - although the expression evaluator was not being called the updates were
still undergoing type-coercion and vector padding/truncation. There is a new
mode called `MAPPER_MODE_RAW` that is used internally only when setting up
convergent maps.
* `MO_REVERSE` has been removed and replaced with directed maps; if a map from
a sink signal to a source signal is desired it is simply set up that way, e.g.
`mapper_map_new(1, &sink_sig, 1, &source_sig)`.
* `MO_CALIBRATE` has been removed and replaced with the `mapper_slot` property
`calibrating`.
* `MO_EXPRESSION` has been renamed `MAPPER_MODE_EXPRESSION`
* `MO_LINEAR` has been renamed `MAPPER_MODE_LINEAR`

### Changes under the hood

There have also been a number of internal improvements that have minimal effect
on the API but improve memory-management and add functionality:

* *Memory management:* Memory is now recovered from dropped connections, e.g.
when a peer device crashes or doesn't disconnect properly.
* *Links.* Devices now create network links automatically as needed.
* *Protocol changes:* In addition to the database subscription changes, some
other updates have been made to the libmapper protocol:
  * null-padding of incomplete vector updates 
  * references to maps in the protocol now have an explicit direction, e.g.
`/map ,sss "/srcdev.1/srcsig" "->" "/dstdev.1/dstsig"`. This means that maps can
now be defined between **any** set of signals, including `output->input`
(a "normal" connection), `input->output` (was a "reverse-mode" connection in
previous versions), `output->output`, and `input->input`
  * instance updates are explicitly tagged with their index, i.e. `@instance 2`
* *Efficient polling:* select() is now used internally to wait on servers,
resulting in less wasted processing and more responsive performance.

### Language bindings

* *C++.* Headers and tests for C++ have been added to the distribution, and
are mostly complete.
* *Python.* The SWIG/Python bindings have been largely rewritten to support
API changes in libmapper and for consistency with other object-oriented
libmapper bindings (C++, Java).
* *Java.* The jni bindings have been largely rewritten to support API changes
in libmapper and to improve consistency.

Version 0.4
-----------

Released August 3, 2016.

This is still a development release, and includes many API changes,
improvements, and new features since 0.3.

They are summarized very briefly here:

### Vector properties

Properties of objects (devices, signals, links, and connections) can now have vector
values. This includes signal minima and maxima, so "linear" mode connections can now
be calibrated per-element.

### Expression parser and evaluator

New capabilities have been added to the expression parser and evaluator, including:

* *User-defined variables.* New variables can be defined implicitly in the
expression, e.g. * `ema=ema{-1}*0.9+x*0.1; y=x-ema`
* *Filter initialization.* Past values of the filter output `y{-n}` can be set using additional sub-expressions, separated using semicolons, e.g. `y=y{-1}+x; y{-1}=100`.
Filter initialization takes place the first time the expression evaluator is called;
after this point the initialization sub-expressions will not be evaluated.
* *Vector indexing.* Elements of vector quantities can now be retrieved by index,
e.g.
  * `y = x[0]` — simple vector indexing
  * `y = x[1:2]` — specify a range within the vector
  * `y = [x[1],x[2],x[0]]` — rearranging vector elements
  * `y[1] = x` — apply update to a specific element of the output
  * `y[0:2] = x` — apply update to elements `0-2` of the output vector
  * `[y[0],y[2]] = x` — apply update to output vector elements `y[0]` and `y[2]` but
leave `y[1]` unchanged.
* *Vector functions.* Several functions that address entire vectors have been added:
`any`, `all`, `min`, `max`, `sum`, `mean`
* *Expression optimization.* Some additional optimizations have been added to the
expression parser, resulting in more efficient compiled expressions.

### Database subscriptions

The underlying protocol for synchronizing databases with the libmapper network has
been switched to a subscription-with-lease model.  This improves the granularity of
reported changes to remote objects while reducing network traffic. Databases are
now properly notified of signal removal.

### Language bindings

The Java bindings have been improved and extended to support libmapper's monitor
functionality.

As usual, this release is subject to API changes and breakage, however libmapper
is starting to approach a more mature and stable state.

Version 0.3
-----------

Released April 26, 2013.

This is still a development release, and includes many API changes,
improvements, and new features since 0.2.

They are summarized very briefly here:

  * _Time._ libmapper now supports timetagging every signal update.  With
    this we include the ability to bundle several signal updates
    together using "queues" which defer sending of updates.  We also
    add an optional `rate` property to signals which can be used to
    represent regularly-sampled signals.  This means that it is
    possible to support "blocks" of data where each sample does not
    have the overhead of an individual message header.  The default
    behaviour, however, is still to send each signal update as an
    individual, time-stamped OSC message, assuming irregular updates.
    Software sampling sensors should be aware of how to distinguish
    between regularly- and irregularly-sampled signals and use the
    correct behaviour accordingly.  At low samples rates, of course,
    the difference is not as important.

  * _Instances._  libmapper now supports the concept of mapping multiple
    "instances" of a signal over a single connection.  This can be
    used for supporting interaction with multi-touch devices as well
    as for polyphonic musical instruments.  A sophisticated "ID map"
    between instances created on a sender and instantiated on the
    receiver is automatically maintained, allowing the synchronization
    of behaviours between the two connection endpoints.  Allocation of
    (possibly limited) resources to individual instances can be
    managed by a callback, which is called when new instances are
    created and old instances are destroyed.  A complete treatment of
    this topic is not possible here, but will be documented in a
    forthcoming paper.

  * _Reverse connections._ A connection mode called `MO_REVERSE` has
    been added which can be used to establish signal from from output
    to input.  The intention is to use this for training machine
    learning systems, allowing the construction of so-called
    example-based "implicit mapping" scenarios.  `MO_REVERSE` of
    course does not invert the mapping expression, so is best-used for
    direct connections to an intermediate device that sits between a
    data source and destination.  Single "snapshots" of output state
    can also be acquired by a query system, using
    `msig_query_remotes()`.

  * _Compatibility with select()._  It is now possible to get a list of
    file descriptors that libmapper reads from.  This can be used as
    arguments to select() or poll() in a program that uses libmapper
    among other sockets or files to read from.

  * _Local link/connection callbacks._ Programs using libmapper can
    now know when a local device has been linked or connected by
    registering a callback for these events.  Although it is not
    encouraged at this time, this can be used for example to implement
    data transport over alternative protocols, using libmapper only
    for determining the destination IP and agreeing on the connection
    details.  In the future we plan to add support for alternative
    protocols within the libmapper framework, so that mapping
    expressions can still be used even when alternatives to OSC are
    used to send and receive data.

  * _Null values._ An important change that users should be aware of
    is that the signal callback (whose signature has changed) can now
    be called with the `value` pointer being zero.  This indicates
    that the mapper signal is actually non-existant, i.e. no value is
    associated with the signal.  That is to say that "null" is now
    considered a valid state for a signal and is different from, for
    example, a value of zero.  User code can choose to ignore this
    case or to make use of it if there is a semantically relevant
    action to take.  An example of this condition is if some signal
    does not have a valid value when some other signal is in a certain
    state, or for reverse connections, a null value might indicate
    that the output has not been set to anything yet.  Local code can
    query the last-updated value of any signal using the `msig_value`
    function.

The tutorial has also been translated for several supported language
bindings: Python, and Max/MSP.  Build documentation has also been
added.

As usual, this release is subject to API changes and breakage, however
libmapper is starting to approach a more mature and stable state.
