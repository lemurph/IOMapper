In order to include an audio example, the libmapper source code
release embeds the excellent RtAudio C++ library for cross-platform
audio support.

The license for RtAudio can be found in the file `RtAudio-readme.txt`.
Note that RtAudio is not installed with libmapper, but is included
only for example purposes.  Since it does not affect the installed
binaries, we expect that the inclusion of the RtAudio source in our
tarball will not cause concern to packagers.

However, if there are any such concerns raised, please don't hesitate
to contact the libmapper developers about them.
