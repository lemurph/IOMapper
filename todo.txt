Plans and TODO list for libmapper + Godot plugin

    TODO:
    - Add support for signals with length > 1; difficulty casting from built-in Godot Array type to C++ vectors/arrays makes this quite challenging
    - Find out how to deal with handler functions/callbacks
    - Add the rest of the necessary libmapper methods
    - Finish README.md
