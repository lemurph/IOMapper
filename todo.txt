Plans and TODO list for libmapper + Godot plugin

    BUGS:
    - For an unknown reason, both the add_sig() and poll()/poll_blocking() methods seem to
        be crashing the scene when they are called in a script, but only on occasion. After
        a couple trials the scene manages to run without issues. This obviously needs to be fixed.
    - Devices created through Godot aren't discoverable on the network, checked using webmapper,
        umapper and libmapper/testmonitor.
    - Error when compiling with mapper::Device or mapper::Signal as return type, it seems Godot
        can only handle limited built-in return types.
    
    TODO:
    - Add the rest of the necessary libmapper methods
    - Come up with interesting applications for the plugin
    - Create tests
    - Write README
