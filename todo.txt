Plans and TODO list for libmapper + Godot plugin

    BUGS:
    - For an unknown reason, both the add_sig() and poll()/poll_blocking() methods seem to
        be crashing the scene when they are called in a script, but only on occasion. After
        a couple trials the scene manages to run without issues, which is strange. This 
        obviously needs to be fixed.
    - Devices created through Godot aren't discoverable on the network, checked using webmapper
        and libmapper/testmonitor.
    - Error when compiling with mapper::Device or mapper::Signal as return type.
    - Error when calling dev.free(), (mapper::Device has no member free())
    
    TODO:
    - Add the rest of the necessary libmapper methods
    - Come up with interesting applications for the plugin
    - Create tests
    - Write README
